The Sun

The sun, a radiant orb of light,
Rises high, a wondrous sight.
Warmth and life it does bestow,
On earth below, its rays do glow.

From dawn to dusk, it shines so bright,
Dispelling shadows of the night.
A constant presence in the sky,
Watching o'er us from on high.

In summer's heat, it blazes strong,
Nurturing growth all season long.
And as it sets, painting skies aflame,
We marvel at its glorious reign.

Oh sun, our faithful guiding star,
Your light and warmth reach near and far.
A symbol of hope, a beacon true,
Forever shining, forever new.
